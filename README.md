# laptop1_dotfiles
my dotfiles for my main laptop

stuff i have installed that are cool(just google them): Pywal
Pywalfox
Matugen
...
Osu
What else
Just copy them dammit
Oh yeah my hyprland.conf has its keyboard layout set to swedish
And you need to put the files in the walset/ directory inside .local/bin   (NOT the folder. the files need to be in .local/bin directly like that)
Walset uses rofi to pick its wallpapers

My wallpaper directory is ~/Wallpapers, but please edit walset and walset-backend to match whatever walset directory you have. 

Which means please edit
