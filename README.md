# laptop1_dotfiles

// Special thanks to saneAspect on youtube that showed me matugen and pywal to create a custom theme switcher. I highly recommend you watch his videos, even though he promotes his course a lot.

That may sound bad but, hes a good creator. Ironically he has enough free content to not need the paid course.

my dotfiles for my main laptop, with arch+hyprland

(Yeah sorry, everything is in the hyprland.conf file. I like having things in one big file my bad)



stuff i have installed that are cool(just google them): 

Pywal

wbthomasons nvim packer, installation below

swww

Pywalfox

Matugen

...

Osu

What else

Just copy them dammit



//Notes

Oh yeah my hyprland.conf has its keyboard layout set to swedish. change that to "en"


And you need to put the files in the walset/ directory inside ~/.local/bin   (NOT the folder. the files need to be in ~/.local/bin directly like that, two files in there)

Walset uses rofi to pick its wallpapers

My wallpaper directory is ~/Wallpapers, but please edit walset and walset-backend to match whatever wallpaper directory you have. 

Which means please copy and edit to your liking


//Additional notes about Matugen

So the colors.conf or colors.css files you see here and there, they are autogenerated by matugen. Matugen and Pywal generate color schemes from a wallpaper.

Which means if you copy these files correcly, you can just pick new wallpapers using walset. I have it configured as $mod_key (windows key) + space.

Custom keybinds are easy to change. Just look at the keybinds in hyprland.conf


//Additional notes about some errors you may encounter

If walset doesnt launch, or doesnt work, you have to do this:

(basically the problem is Hyprland doesnt know where it is)

Check if you forgot to put those files in ~/.local/bin

Check if you can even execute them. "chmod +x ~/.local/bin/walset" and "chmod +x ~/.local/bin/walset-backend" and run sudo if it asks for permission

Modify the walset file, "~/.local/bin/walset", change "walset-backend" into 

"~/.local/bin/walset-backend" basically clarify the full directory location

Go into the hyprland.conf, change "bind = $mainMod, space, exec, walset" and instead of walset but "~/.local/bin/walset"

Why? I dont know, i think hyprland.conf just doesnt know where walset is. it just works on my laptop, but my desktop with pretty much the same stuff, has troubles. If it works then congrats.


//Why does waybar say "Kob" because its what my vietnamese uncle calls me because he cant say Jakob. just change the "config" file in the waybar directory to whatever u want





//NEOVIM error, file not found or whatever. ALSO PACKER INSTALLATION!!!!

//NVIM OVER HERE!!!

run this

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim/ ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim

do this and uhh, it should work. if it says there is already something there, please cd into ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/

and do rm -rf packer.nvim   //if it says permission denied do sudo rm -rf packer.nvim
